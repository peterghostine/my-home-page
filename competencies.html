              <p><span>WordPress</span> is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) written in PHP and
                paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database. Features include a plugin architecture and a template system,
                referred to within WordPress as Themes. WordPress was originally created as a blog-publishing system but
                has evolved to support other web content types including more traditional mailing lists and forums,
                media galleries, membership sites, learning management systems (LMS) and online stores. WordPress is one
                of the most popular content management system solutions in use, and it is used by 42.8% of the top 10
                million websites as of October 2021.</p>
              <p><span>WooCommerce</span> is an open-source e-commerce plugin for WordPress. It is designed for small to
                large-sized online merchants using WordPress. Launched on September 27, 2011, the plugin quickly became
                popular for its simplicity to install and customize and for the market position of the base product as
                freeware (even though many of its optional extensions are paid and proprietary).</p>

              <h3 id="php"></h3>
              <p><span>PHP</span> is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development. It was
                originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference
                implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now
                stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.</p>
              <p> PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon
                or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and
                executed PHP code – which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data – would
                form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management
                systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of
                that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, such as
                standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control. PHP code can also be directly executed from
                the command line.</p>
              <p>The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP
                License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on a variety of operating
                systems and platforms.</p>
              <p>The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the
                original implementation acting as the de facto standard which other implementations aimed to follow.
                Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.</p>
              <p>W3Techs reports that, as of April 2021, "PHP is used by 79.2% of all the websites whose server-side
                programming language we know."</p>

              <h3 id="html"></h3>
              <p><span>The HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</span> is the standard markup language for documents
                designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style
                Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
              <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
                into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
                included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
              <p><span>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</span> is a style sheet language used for describing the
                presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone card of the
                World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
              <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
                fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more ibility and control in the
                specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
                specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the
                structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between
                the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
              <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in
                different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via
                speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for
                alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.</p>
              <p><span>JavaScript (JS)</span> is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
                JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled and multi-paradigm. It has dynamic typing,
                prototype-based object-orientation and first-class functions.</p>
              <p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. Over 97% of
                websites use it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major
                web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.</p>
              <p>As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming
                styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular
                expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). </p>
              <p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or
                graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for
                I/O.</p>
              <p>JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of some
                servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.</p>
              <p>Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and
                respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>

              <p><span>Bootstrap</span> is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first
                front-end web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for
                typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.</p>
              <p>As of August 2021, Bootstrap is the tenth most starred project on GitHub, with over 152,000 stars,
                behind freeCodeCamp (over 328,000 stars), Vue.js framework, React library, TensorFlow and others.</p>
              <p>Bootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter
                as a framework to encourage consistency across internal tools. Before Bootstrap, various libraries were
                used for interface development, which led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden. According to
                Twitter developer Mark Otto:</p>
              <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework)">A super small group of
                developers and I got together to design and build a new internal tool and saw an opportunity to do
                something more. Through that process, we saw ourselves build something much more substantial than
                another internal tool. Months later, we ended up with an early version of Bootstrap as a way to document
                and share common design patterns and assets within the company.</blockquote>
              <p>After a few months of development by a small group, many developers at Twitter began to contribute to
                the project as a part of Hack Week, a hackathon-style week for the Twitter development team. It was
                renamed from Twitter Blueprint to Bootstrap, and released as an open source project on August 19, 2011.
                It has continued to be maintained by Mark Otto, Jacob Thornton, and a small group of core developers, as
                well as a large community of contributors.</p>

                the permissive MIT License. As of May 2019, jQuery is used by 73% of the 10 million most popular
                websites. Web analysis indicates that it is the most widely deployed JavaScript library by a large
                margin, having at least 3 to 4 times more usage than any other JavaScript library.</p>
              <p class=" padding-bottom-1rem padding-right-2rem">jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to
                navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax
                applications. jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the
                JavaScript library. This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and
                animation, advanced effects and high-level, themeable widgets. The modular approach to the jQuery
                library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and Web applications.</p>
              <p class=" padding-bottom-1rem padding-right-2rem">The set of jQuery core features &#8212 DOM element

                architecture of other JavaScript frameworks like YUI v3 and Dojo, later stimulating the creation of the
                standard Selectors API. Later, this style has been enhanced with a deeper algorithm-data fusion in an
                heir of jQuery, the D3.js framework.</p>

                runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use
                JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting, i.e., running scripts server-side
                to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently,
                Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a
                single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.
